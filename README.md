Artist Identification using Deep Learning
Project Overview:
Art identification is a challenging problem with significant implications in art history, curation, and authentication. This project aims to develop an accurate and efficient system for automatically identifying and categorizing artworks based on their respective artists. The focus is on leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for feature extraction and classification.

Problem Statement:
The primary goal is to build a robust artist identification system capable of distinguishing the unique styles of different artists. For example, the system should be able to differentiate between Van Gogh's bold colors and distorted shapes and Gauguin's warmer color palette. The dataset used in this project consists of 8,355 paintings from 50 renowned artists.

Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is twofold - a passion for art and a keen interest in image classification. By working on this project, there is an opportunity to explore various image classification architectures and gain practical experience. The use of transfer learning, especially, provides a chance to apply novel approaches and expand knowledge in the realm of deep learning.

Objectives:
Develop a deep learning model, primarily using CNNs, for accurate feature extraction and classification of artworks.
Utilize transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models and explore techniques to improve the accuracy of the artist identification system.
Apply data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.
Provide a valuable resource for art education, allowing students to explore and learn about various artists and their works.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project comprises 8,355 paintings from 50 artists, with Van Gogh and Degas being the top two classes. The dataset was collected by Icaro and is publicly available on Kaggle.

Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Explore and clean the dataset.
Resize images to a standardized format.
Normalize pixel values.
2. Model Architecture:
Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
Utilize dense layers for classification.
Explore different architectures for optimal performance.
3. Transfer Learning:
Leverage pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for transfer learning.
Fine-tune models to adapt to the specific characteristics of the art dataset.
4. Data Augmentation:
Apply augmentation techniques to artificially increase the diversity of the training dataset.
Improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
5. Evaluation:
Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.
Results:
Provide insights into the model's accuracy, strengths, and potential areas for improvement.
